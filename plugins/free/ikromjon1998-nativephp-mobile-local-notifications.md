Schedule, manage, and cancel local notifications in your NativePHP Mobile app — no server or Firebase required.

## Quick Start

```php
use Ikromjon\LocalNotifications\Facades\LocalNotifications;

// Request permission (required on Android 13+ and iOS)
LocalNotifications::requestPermission();

// Schedule a notification in 10 seconds
LocalNotifications::schedule([
    'id' => 'welcome',
    'title' => 'Hello!',
    'body' => 'Your first local notification',
    'delay' => 10,
]);
```

## How is this different?

| Plugin | What it does | Requires |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **nativephp/mobile-dialog** | Toast/snackbar messages (in-app only, disappear when app closes) | Nothing |
| **nativephp/mobile-firebase** | Push notifications from a server via FCM/APNs | Firebase project, server, internet |
| **This plugin** | Local notifications scheduled on-device | Nothing — works offline |

## Features

- Schedule notifications with a delay or at a specific time
- Repeat intervals: minute, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly
- Custom repeat intervals (any duration >= 60 seconds)
- Day-of-week scheduling (e.g. every Mon/Wed/Fri at 9 AM)
- Repeat count limits (fire N times then stop)
- Rich content: images, subtitles, and expanded text
- Action buttons with text input support (configurable limit, default 3)
- Native snooze (reschedules without opening the app)
- Custom sounds, badges, and data payloads
- Cancel individual or all notifications
- List pending notifications
- Update existing notifications
- Permission management (Android 13+, iOS)
- Laravel Notification channel support
- Survives device reboot (Android)
- Events for notification lifecycle (scheduled, received, tapped, action pressed)
- Cold-start tap event auto-flush via Blade component
- Works completely offline — no server or Firebase needed
